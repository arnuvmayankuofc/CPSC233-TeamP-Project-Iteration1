# CPSC233-TeamP-Project-Iteration1

This is Team P's U of C style Monopoly game, Universopoly of Calgary

To access this project, go to CPSC233-Team-Project-Iteration1 and clone the package to your GitHub Desktop. Then, you can sync that import that repository to your Eclipse IDE by going to File > Import > Git > Projects from Git (smart import) and select the aforementioned repository. Then, you can click Run, and the main function of the Main class should run and start the whole application.

The uxf file of the class diagram is the best way of viewing it, but we've also added a PNG file in case that does not work, albeit it is quite blurry.

The updated team contract and project proposal are present as well.
